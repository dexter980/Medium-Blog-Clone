[For generating/synchronizing types based on your Worker configuration run](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#types):

npm run cf-typegen
```

Pass the `CloudflareBindings` as generics when instantiation `Hono`:

```ts
// src/index.ts
const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: CloudflareBindings }>()
```

#whenever we have a env variable in ts or hono you  have to pass it as a generic as we did in index.ts
